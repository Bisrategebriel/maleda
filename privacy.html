              <p>
                This policy applies to all tyt users, including Riders and
                Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all tyt platforms
                and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other
                services (collectively, the &ldquo;tyt Platform&rdquo;). Please
                remember that your use of the tyt Platform is also subject to
                our Terms of Service.
              </p>

              <p>The Information We Collect</p>

              <p>
                When you use the tyt Platform, we collect the information you
                provide, usage information, and information about your device.
                We also collect information about you from other sources like
                third-party services, and optional programs in which you
                participate, which we may combine with other information we have
                about you. Here are the types of information we collect about
                you:
              </p>

              <p>A. Information You Provide to Us</p>

              <p>
                Account Registration. When you create an account with tyt, we
                collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email
                address, phone number, birth date, and payment information. You
                may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider
                profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or
                work), and set up other preferences (such as your preferred
                pronouns).<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a
                Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your
                application, including your name, email address, phone number,
                birth date, profile photo, physical address, government
                identification number (such as social security number),
                driver&rsquo;s license information, vehicle information, and car
                insurance information. We collect the payment information you
                provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax
                information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also
                ask for additional business license or permit information or
                other information to manage driving and programs relevant to
                that location. We may need additional information from you at
                some point after you become a Driver, including information to
                confirm your identity (like a photo).<br />
                <br />
                <strong>SOS Contact Information</strong> We will collect the
                contact list permission to list the contacts while adding the
                sos contacts for user & driver app<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide
                feedback about Riders or Drivers, we collect all of the
                information you provide in your feedback.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Communications.</strong> When you contact us or we
                contact you, we collect any information that you provide,
                including the contents of the messages or attachments you send
                us.
              </p>

              <p>B. Information We Collect When You Use the tyt Platform</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an
                easy and accurate pickup. The tyt Platform collects location
                information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending
                on your tyt app settings and device permissions as well as
                whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Riders: We collect your device&rsquo;s precise location when
                  you open and use the tyt app, including while the app is
                  running in the background from the time you request a ride
                  until it ends. tyt also tracks the precise location of
                  scooters and e-bikes at all times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Drivers: We collect your device&rsquo;s precise location when
                  you open and use the app, including while the app is running
                  in the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect
                  precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode
                  in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it
                  until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about
                your use of the tyt Platform, including ride information like
                the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and
                whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect
                information about your interactions with the tyt Platform like
                our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view
                and the dates and times of your use.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information
                about the devices you use to access the tyt Platform, including
                device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating
                system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such
                as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language),
                application installations, device identifiers, advertising
                identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver,
                we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as
                speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
                technical data).<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We
                work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text
                messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either
                party&rsquo;s actual phone number with the other. But while we
                use a third party to provide the communication service, we
                collect information about these communications, including the
                participants&rsquo; phone numbers, the date and time, and the
                contents of SMS messages. For security purposes, we may also
                monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the
                tyt Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do
                so before the call begins.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device
                permissions to grant tyt access to your contact lists and direct
                tyt to access your contact list, for example to help you refer
                friends to tyt. If you do this, we will access and store the
                names and contact information of the people in your address
                book.<br />
                <br />
                <strong

                >
                We collect information through the use of &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;,
                tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics,
                SDKs, and other third-party technologies to understand how you
                navigate through the tyt Platform and interact with tyt
                advertisements, to make your tyt experience safer, to learn what
                content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve
                you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences.
                Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your

                session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie

                browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if
                you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss

              <p>How We Share Your Information</p>

              <p>
                We do not sell your personal information. To make the tyt
                Platform work, we may need to share your personal information
                with other users, third parties, and service providers. This
                section explains when and why we share your information.
              </p>

              <p>A. Sharing Between tyt Users</p>

              <p>
                Riders and Drivers.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Rider information shared with Driver:</strong> Upon
                receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the
                Rider&rsquo;s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating,
                Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as
                a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider
                profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the
                ride, we share with the Driver the Rider&rsquo;s destination and
                any additional stops the Rider inputs into the tyt app. Once the
                ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider&rsquo;s
                rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the
                Rider&rsquo;s identity associated with ratings and feedback when
                we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify
                the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Driver information shared with Rider:</strong> Upon a
                Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider
                the Driver&rsquo;s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns,
                rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color,
                and license plate, as well as other information in the
                Driver&rsquo;s tyt profile, such as information Drivers choose
                to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver
                statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a
                Driver).<br />
                <br />
                Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another
                to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or
                other contact information with other users. If you report a lost
                or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the
                relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact
                information with your consent.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a tyt
                Shared ride, we share each Rider&rsquo;s name and profile
                picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other&rsquo;s
                pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while
                sharing the ride.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some
                rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you
                take one of those rides using your tyt Business Profile account,
                a code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or
                government), or a corporate credit card linked to another
                account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride
                for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that
                other party, including the date, time, charge, rating given,
                region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your
                ride.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the
                tyt Platform, we will let them know that you generated the
                referral. If another user referred you, we may share information
                about your use of the tyt Platform with that user. For example,
                a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the tyt
                Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive
                such information.
